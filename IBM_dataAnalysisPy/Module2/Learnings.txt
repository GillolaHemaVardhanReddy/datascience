objectives :
    1. Identify and handle missing values
    2. data formatting (multiple diffrent formats to convert to same format using pandas)
    3. Data normalization : diffrent columns of diffrent columns have very diffrent ranges which makes direct comparision 
                            meaningless
                            normalization is a way to make all the data into similar range for more useful comparision
        (centering/scaling)
    4.  data binning : it creates bigger categories for a set of numerical values which is used for comparision between 
                        group of data
    5. turing categorical values to numeric variables
