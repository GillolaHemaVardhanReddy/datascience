data wraggling : Data wrangling, also known as data munging or data cleaning or data preprocessing, is the process of cleaning, transforming, 
and preparing raw data for analysis.
This process involves various steps to ensure that the data is in the right format, consistent, 
and free of errors or missing values, making it suitable for analysis and visualization

this process includes steps :
    1. Data Cleaning: Identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies in the data. 
        This can involve handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.

    2. Data Transformation: Converting data from one format or structure to another. This includes normalizing or 
        standardizing data, encoding categorical variables, and creating new features or columns.
    
    3. Data Integration: Combining data from multiple sources to provide a unified dataset. 
        This can involve merging, joining, or concatenating datasets, as well as aligning data from different sources.

    4. Data Reduction: Simplifying the dataset by reducing the number of variables or observations. 
        This can be achieved through techniques like dimensionality reduction, aggregation, and filtering
    
    5. Data Enrichment: Enhancing the dataset by adding additional information from external sources. 
        This can involve merging in data from other databases, APIs, or other relevant sources.
    
    6. Data Validation: Ensuring that the data is accurate, complete, and consistent. 
        This step often includes validating data against predefined rules or standards.
    
    7. Data Structuring: Organizing data into a structured format suitable for analysis. 
        This involves creating tables, defining relationships, and setting up the necessary schema for the data.


The goal of data wrangling is to transform raw data into a 
clean and usable form that can be easily analyzed, visualized, and used for decision-making processes.


pre processing : the process of converting or mapping data from the initial "raw" form into another format 
                inorder to prepare the data for further analysis

data preprocessing is often called data wrangling or data cleaning
