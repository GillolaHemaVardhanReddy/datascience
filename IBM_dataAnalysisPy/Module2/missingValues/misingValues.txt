what is missing values ?
missing values occure when no data values is stored for a variable (feature) in an observation
* they could be represented as "?" , "N/A" , 0 or just a blank cell

HOW TO DEAL WITH MISSING DATA : 
there are many ways to deal with missing data
    1. check if you can find missing values from data source 
    2. drop the missing values :
                * either drop full variable 
                * or drop the data entry 
        drop only those with least impact on results
    3. replacing the missing values 
        if we just guess or caliculate it and replace it then it might be inaccurate so best possible solution will be :
                * replace it with an average (of similar data points / column)
        above one is valid for numeric entries but for non numeric entry best possible sol is :
                * replace it with a high frequency element in the column
        and in some cases we replace them using some functions
    4. leave it as missing data / as it is : sometimes its more useful in future so leave the data be

To drop in pandas we use pandas:
    1. .dropna(subset=["columnName"],axis=1/0,inplace=True) 
                 method --> attributes for function are : axis = 0 for rows  axis = 1 for columns
                                                          inplace = True --> directly writes data to dataframe
                                                          subset=["colmnName"] --> data which column we want to delete
    2. .replace(missingVal,newVal)
            --> replace with mean of whole column/group is best way 
                to do mean use .mean()
