statement : can we estimate the price of used cars?

tom wants to sell his car but for how much money?
price he sets should not be too high, but not too low either

how can we help tom  as a data scientist?

first a data sciuentist should ask questions to solve his problem :
    1. is there data on the prices of other cars and their charecteristics ?
    2. what features of car affect their prices ? (like color? brand? horsepower? etc...)
    etc...
