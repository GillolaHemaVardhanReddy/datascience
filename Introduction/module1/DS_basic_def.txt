a data scientist as someone who finds solutions 
to problems by analyzing Big or small data using appropriate tools and then tells stories to 
communicate her findings to the relevant stakeholders

data scientist isn't someone who's restricted to data sciece 
he's someone who has a 
        curious mind, 
        fluency in analytics and 
        the ability to communicate the findings 

Dr Granville uses restrictions on data size and methods to define what data science is
He defines a data scientist as one who can easily process a So-million-row data set in a couple of hours,
and who distrusts (statistical) models

He distinguishes data science from statistics. Yet he lists algebra, 
calculus, and training in probability and statistics as necessary background to understand data science

Stata, a commonly used software by data scientists and statisticians, 
announced that one could now process between 2 billion to 24.4 billion rows using its desktop solutions

Dr Patil told the Guardian newspaper in 2012 that a data scientist is that unique 
blend of skills that can both 
        unlock the insights of data and 
        tell a fantastic story via the data.

The other key ingredient for a successful data scientist is a behavioral trait: curiosity
A data scientist has to be one with a very curious mind, willing to spend significant time and effort to explore her hunches

Dr Schutt defined a 
data scientist as someone who is 
        a part computer scientist, 
        part software engineer, and 
        part statistician (Miller, 2013). 
But that's the definition of an average data scientist. 
"The best", she contended, 
        "tend to be really curious people, 
        thinkers who ask good questions and 
        are O.K. dealing with unstructured situations and 
        trying to find structure in them."
