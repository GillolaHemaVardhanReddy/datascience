MODEL : A representation of the relationships and 
        patterns found in data to make predictions or 
        analyze complex systems retaining essential elements needed for analysis.
OUTLIERS : When a data point or points occur significantly outside 
           of most of the other data in a data set, potentially indicating anomalies, 
           errors, or unique phenomena that could impact statistical analysis or modeling.

QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS : A systematic approach using mathematical and 
                        statistical analysis is used to interpret numerical data.

STRUCTURED DATA : Data is organized and formatted into a 
                  predictable schema, usually related tables with rows and columns.

UNSTRUCTURED DATA : Unorganized data that lacks a predefined data model or organization makes 
                    it harder to analyze using traditional methods. This data type often includes 
                    text, images, videos, and other content that doesnâ€™t fit neatly into rows and columns like structured data.

DATA FORMAT : 	How data is encoded so it can be stored within a data file type.

DATA VISUALIZATIONS : 	A visual way, such as a graph, 
                of representing data in a readily understandable way makes it easier to see trends in the data.

hadoop : An open-source framework designed to store and process large datasets across clusters of computers.

PANDAS : 	An open-source Python library that provides tools for working with structured data is often used for data manipulation and analysis.
