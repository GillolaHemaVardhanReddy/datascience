GERENATIVE AI : it is a subset of AI. that focuses on producing new data rather than just analysing existing one

* it helps in creating content like Images,Music,Language,code etc.. 
How does GERENATIVE AI  operate :?
Deeplearning models like 
     generative adversial networks (GANs)
     variational auto-encoders (VAEs)

APPLICATIONS OF GENERATIVE AI :
* natural language processing
* healthcare
* ART and design
* gaming
* fashion and retail

HOW DATA SCIENTISTS USE GENERATIVE AI :
* building data models takes a lot of data 
* data sets may not have enough data to build a model 
    as we cannot find observations to build a model in many cases so we use sythetic data using generative AI
* data SCIENTISTS can augument their data sets using generative ai to create synthatic data 
* it creates new data which is exact math to original
* after generative AI create this synthatic data we use it for model training and testing

it solves data science efforts
