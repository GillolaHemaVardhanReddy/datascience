MACHINE LEARNING : it is a subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and
                make intelligent decisions based on what it has learned without being explicitly programmed

* machine learning algorithms are trained with large sets of data
* they learn from examples
* they do not follow rule based algorithms
* machine learning is what enables machine to solve problems on its own and make accurate predictions based on data

DEEP LEARNING : it is a subset of machine learning that uses layred neural networks to simulate 
                human decision making

* it can lable and categorize data and identify patterns 
* it is what enables AI systems to learn on a job and improve quality and quantity of the job

ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORKS : it is also referred as neural networks took insiration from biological neural networks 
            although they work quite a bit diffrently

* a NN in AI is a collection of small computing units called neurons that take incomming data and 
    learn to make decisions over time
* NN are often layered deep which makes deeplearning algorithms efficient 


***
    data science and AI are not subsets of each other 
    data science uses some important techniques of AI like ML
    both AI and data science can use BIG DATA
