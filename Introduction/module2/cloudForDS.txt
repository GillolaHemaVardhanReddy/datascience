cloud allows a physical computer to bypass its limitations on storage
it also helps to deploy a large complex algorithm

if we have data and can't store on your pc you can send or store it in virtual storage space called cloud

we can use really complex computation algorithm and use it on big data set using cloud even
when your pc won't support

cloud allows multiple entities to work on same dataset at same time

using cloud enables us to get instant acces to open source technology or most uptodate tools without the need to locally installing
or configuring them locally

you don't have to worry about updating the tools you use using cloud it ensures they are up to date

cloud is accessible using diffrent devices and multiple users accross glob
