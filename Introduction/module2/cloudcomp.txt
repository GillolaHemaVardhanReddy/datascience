objectives :
1. describe cloud computing concepts 
2. define cloud deployment models and cloud service models
3. identify the charecteristics of cloud computing

what is cloud computing ?
Delivery of ondemand computing resources like
    * networks 
    * servers
    * storage
    * applications 
    * services 
    * data centers
over the internet on a pay for use basis

cloud computing is applications and data that users access over the internet rather than locally
    * online web applications
    * secure online bussiness applications
    * storing personal files eg: google drive , onedrive , dropbox
user benifits :
    * no need to purchase applications and install  them on local computer
    * use online version of applications and pay monthly subscriptions
    * more cost effective
    * access most current software versions
    * save localstorage space
    * work collaboratively in real time

cloud computing consists of :
    5 charecteristics
    3 deployment models
    3 service models

five charecteristics of coud computing :
1. on demand self service 
    where we get access to cloud resources :
        * processing power
        * storage
        * and network 
    using a simple interface 
2. broad network access 
    resources can be accessed via the network through standard mechanisms and platforms
    such as mobilephone , laptop , tablet
3. resource pooiling is what gives cloud providers economies of scale and pass on to their customers 
    making cloud cost efficient 
4. rapid elasticity implies that we can access more resources when we need them and scale back when we don't
5. measured services means we only pay for only what we use 
    resource usage is measured,monitered and reported based on user utilization

cloud deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides who owns and manages it and how cloud resources and services
are made available to users

3 TYPES of cloud deployment models :

1. private cloud : this cloud infrastructure is provisioned exclusively for specific firm
2. public cloud : this is shared and used by many companies over open internet 
its on hardware of cloud provider but used by other companies
3. hybrid cloud : mix of above two

3 cloud service models based on 3 layers on computing stack :
    1. IaaS : infrastructure as a service
    2. PaaS : platform as a service
    3. SaaS : software as a service
