1. analytics : The process of examining data to draw conclusions and make informed decisions is a fundamental 
                aspect of data science, involving statistical analysis and data-driven insights.

2. bigdata : Vast amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data are characterized by its volume, velocity, 
            variety, and value, which, when analyzed, can provide competitive advantages and drive digital transformations.

3. bigdata cluster : A distributed computing environment comprising thousands or tens 
                of thousands of interconnected computers that collectively store and process large datasets.

4. CDO chief data officer : An emerging role responsible for overseeing data-related initiatives, governance, 
            and strategies, ensuring that data plays a central role in digital transformation efforts.

5. CIO chief information officer : An executive is responsible for managing an organization's information 
                technology and computer systems, contributing to technology-related aspects of digital transformation.

6. cloud computing : The delivery of on-demand computing resources, including networks, servers, storage, 
            applications, services, and data centers, over the Internet on a pay-for-use basis.

7. cloud deployment models : Categories that indicate where cloud infrastructure resides, who manages it, and 
            how cloud resources and services are made available to users, including public, private, and hybrid models.

8. cloud service models : Models based on the layers of a computing stack, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), 
                Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), represent different cloud computing offerings.

9. data algorithms : Computational procedures and mathematical models used to process and analyze data 
                made accessible in the cloud for data scientists to deploy on large datasets efficiently.

10. deep learning : A subset of machine learning that involves artificial neural networks inspired by 
                the human brain, capable of learning and making complex decisions from data on their own.

11. distributed data : The practice of dividing data into smaller chunks and distributing them 
                across multiple computers within a cluster enables parallel processing for data analysis.	

12. hadoop : A distributed storage and processing framework used for handling and analyzing 
                large datasets, particularly well-suited for big data analytics and data science applications.

13. HDFS hadoop distributed file system : A storage system within the Hadoop framework that partitions 
                and distributes files across multiple nodes, facilitating parallel data access and fault tolerance.

14. Iaas infrastructure as a service : A cloud service model that provides access to computing infrastructure, 
                including servers, storage, and networking, without the need for users to manage or operate them.

15. MapProcess : The initial step in Hadoopâ€™s MapReduce programming model, where data is 
                processed in parallel on individual cluster nodes, often used for data transformation tasks.

16. ReduceProcess : The second step in Hadoop's MapReduce model is where results from the mapping 
                process are aggregated and processed further to produce the final output, typically used for analysis.

17. Resource pooling : A cloud characteristic where computing resources are shared and 
                dynamically assigned to multiple consumers, promoting economies of scale and cost-efficiency.

18. V's of bigdata : 	A set of characteristics common across Big Data definitions, including Velocity, 
                Volume, Variety, Veracity, and Value, highlighting the rapid generation, scale, diversity, quality, and value of data.
