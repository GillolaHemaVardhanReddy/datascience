1. artificial neural networks : Collections of small computing units (neurons) that process data and learn to 
                make decisions over time.

2. cluster analysis : The process of grouping similar data points together based on certain features or attributes.

3. coding automation : Using generative AI to automatically generate and test software code for constructing 
                analytical models, freeing data scientists to focus on higher-level tasks.

4. data mining : The process of automatically searching and analyzing data to discover patterns 
                and insights that were previously unknown.

5. Decision trees : A type of machine learning algorithm used for decision-making by creating a tree-like structure of decisions.
