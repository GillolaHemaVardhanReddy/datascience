    Methodology : 
    * Purpose: Explain the research methods and data sources.
    * Content : 
        Research Design: Overall approach and rationale.
        Data Sources: Description of new or existing data, sampling methods, and data collection procedures.

        Empirical Techniques: Data mining or other relevant techniques.
    * Presentation: Use graphics to make findings palatable, especially for business reports.

    Discussion : 
    * Purpose: Craft the main arguments based on the results.
