python packages/libraries for data science: 

python data analysis libraries are of 3 groups they are :

    1. sientific computing libraries:
        * pandas: offers data structures and tools for effective data manipulation and analysis
        * numpy : it provides arrays and matrices for faster processing with high computation speed
        * scipy : includes functions for some complex maths like = integrals,solving diffrential equations,optimizations
    2. visualization libraries :
        * matplotlib : great for making graphs and plots => graphs are highly coustamizable
        * seaborn : it is built on matplotlib to draw more charts like => heatmaps,time series , voilin plots
    3. algorithmic libraries : 
        * scikit-learn : used to suply machin learning algo like regression, classification , clustering etc...
                        this library is built on numpy,scipy and matplotlib 
        * stats models : allows users to explore data , estimate statistical models and tests
