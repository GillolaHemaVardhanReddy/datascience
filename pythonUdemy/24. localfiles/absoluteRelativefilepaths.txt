absolute file path:
/ => represents C drive or root folder
/programFiles => now we entered programFiles folder
/snakegame => entered snakegame folder and we have access to all files in it
/snakegame/main.py => now we are accessing main.py in snakegame folder

relative file path: this path is like getting access for other files/folders from current folder 
folder structure:
projects
    snakegame
        classes
            class1.py
            class2.py
        main.py
    ponggame
        classes
            class3.py
        main.py

lets say we are in snakegame folder
to access main.py we use relative path 
    ./main.py
to access class1.py in classes we use
    ./classes/class1.py
to access ponggame folder we use
    ../ponggame

./ => this represent current folder
../ => this represent upper folder relative to current folder
