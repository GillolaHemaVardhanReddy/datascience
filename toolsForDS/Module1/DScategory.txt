1. data management :
    * collecting, persisting, and retriving data securely, effectively, and cost effectively
    * data is collected from many sources
2. data integration and transformation 
    * it is a process of extracting, transforming and loading (ETL)
    * extract the data and sae it in the central repository like a data wearhouse
    * data transformation is the process of transforming the values, structure and format of data
    * transformed data is loaded back to the data warehouse
3. data visualization 
    * graphical representation of data and information in form of charts, lots, maps, and animations 
    * it conveys data more efficiently
4. model building
    * model building is a step where you train data and analyze patterns using suitable machine learning algorithms 
    * create ML models using ibm watson machine learning
5. model deployment
    * integrating a model into a production environment
    * model deployment uses apis to enable data based decisions
6. model monitoring and assessment
    * track perfpormance of the model in production environment
    * model assessment checks for accuracy, fairness, and robust monitoring


to do above all we need 
1. data asset management 
2. code asset management (github)
    * it is a unified view where you manage an inventory of assets 
    * developers use versioning to track and manage changes to a software projects code
3. development environment
    * provides tools and workspace
4. execution environments
